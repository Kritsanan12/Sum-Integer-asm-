algorithm atoi:
Set result = 0 (used to store numeric results)
Sets the pointer to the first character of the input string.
Repeat the following steps until you reach the end of the string:
1. Read the current character that the pointer is pointing to.
2. If the character is null terminator (0) or newline (10), exit the loop.
3. Convert letters to numbers by subtracting the ASCII value of '0'.
4. Multiply the result by 10 (move the digit to the left).
5. Add the converted numerical values ​​to the result.
6. Move the pointer to the next character.
Return result

algorithm itoa:
Takes an integer value as input.
Prepare a buffer for storing the result string. (Minimum size 10 bytes for 32-bit integers)
Start at the end of the buffer (position 9).
Put a null terminator (0) at the end of the string.
Repeat the following steps until input is 0:
1. Move back one position in the buffer.
2. Divide the input remainder by 10 (input % 10).
3. Convert the remainder into ASCII characters by adding the ASCII value of '0'.
4. Store the converted characters into a buffer at the current location.
5. Divide input by 10 (input = input / 10)
Returns the starting position of a string in the buffer.
